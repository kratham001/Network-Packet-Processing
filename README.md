Network Packet Processing Using RTOS

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project simulates a Network Packet Processing System using FreeRTOS. It demonstrates how to handle network packets in a real-time system, where tasks are responsible for packet reception, processing, and forwarding. The system is implemented in C and built using the FreeRTOS kernel for task management, with communication handled using FreeRTOS queues.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p></p>Packet Reception: Simulates the receipt of network packets from various sources.
Packet Processing: Processes each packet, modifying its content for forwarding.
Packet Forwarding: Forwards processed packets to their destination.
Real-time scheduling and queue-based communication using FreeRTOS.
Modular code structure with separate tasks for each function (Reception, Processing, Forwarding).</p>
